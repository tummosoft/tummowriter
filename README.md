Turn MS Word into a perfect software tool for writing long texts

Tummo Writer Pro is a seamlessly integrated add-in software for Microsoft Word, mainly for creative and professional writers. The most important concept of Tummo Writer is project-based writing.

A project in Tummo Writer is a long or complex text that you might work on for days, weeks, or even months, for example, a book (novel, or non-fiction), a research paper, a serious of columns, a personal diary, or even a note book.

With Tummo Writer, you manage and write each piece of your long writing projects as smaller separate documents, because smaller separate documents are more manageable for a long or complex wring project.
